####create a formula that adds amount of credit card and cash tips and divides by number of bartenders on the split.



class split_tips:
    def __init__(self, cash, ccards, open_tabs, bartenders):
        self.cash = cash
        self.ccards = ccards
        self.open_tabs = open_tabs
        self.bartenders = bartenders

        ### add sum of cash and credit card tips plus 10 percent of open tabs and divide by number of bartenders.
    def first_split():
        pass

        ##### repeat formula taking in new inputs and subtracting credit card tips from previous split



        



cash = int(input('Enter cash total:        '))
ccards =int(input('Enter total cc tips:     '))
open_tabs = int(input('Enter the total of open tabs:    '))
bartenders = int(input('Enter number of bartenders to split:    '))
